My name is Inna Mamedova, I am a student of Birmingham University Coding Bootcamp.
In this challenge I have build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying the starter code.



# Project requirements
Create a backend for e-commerce website using Express.js, Sequelize and a MySQL database.



# Details

I have created GET request for categories, products, and tags to retrieve data from database.
I have created POST request for categories and tags to add new data to database.
I have created PUT request for categories and tags to update data in database.
I have created DELETE request for categories, products, and tags to delete old data from database.
